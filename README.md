# Ocean Alliance

Ocean Alliance is a program based in Gloucester, Massachusetts that studies the behavioral patterns and genetics of different species of whales.

Their team is responsible for the creation of the SnotBot&reg;, which is a drone that collects snot from the whale's blow (the air that is expelled from their blowholes). This allows access to whale DNA without interfering with the whale invasively.
